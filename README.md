## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup for structuring the component.
- **CSS3** – Custom properties and Flexbox for a responsive design.
- **Mobile-first workflow** – Ensuring the design is optimized for smaller devices first.
- **Google Fonts** – For clean and modern typography.

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of Flexbox and responsive design. It also helped me deepen my knowledge of CSS custom properties, which make the code more maintainable. For example, here's a snippet that demonstrates how I centered content:


```css

#container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    margin-left: 450px;
    margin-top: 100px;
    width: 290px;
    height: 460px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 20px;    
}
```


###  Continued development
In future projects, I plan to:

Enhance my understanding of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
Improve accessibility by incorporating ARIA roles and better semantic HTML.
Integrate JavaScript to add interactivity to components.
