What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of Flexbox and how to create a responsive layout. I also practiced using CSS custom properties for colors and typography, which made the code more maintainable.

Here’s an example of a CSS snippet I’m proud of:

#container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    margin-left: 450px;
    margin-top: 100px;
    width: 290px;
    height: 460px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 20px;    
}


This snippet demonstrates how I used Flexbox to center the content and create a clean, responsive layout.

Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

Improving my understanding of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
Enhancing accessibility by using ARIA roles and semantic HTML.
Exploring JavaScript to add interactivity to components.
